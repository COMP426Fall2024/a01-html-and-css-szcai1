            Charizard is a powerful, dragon-like Pokémon known for its fiery
            breath and impressive aerial abilities. Standing on two legs with a
            long tail that ends in a flame, Charizard is orange with a pair of
            large wings that enable it to fly at great speeds. It has a rugged
            snout, a horn-like crest on its head, and sharp claws on its hands
            and feet. Charizard's flame burns hotter when it is furious, and it
            can melt anything in its path with its intense fire breath. It is a
            highly skilled flyer and often soars high in the skies searching for
            powerful opponents to battle. Despite its fierce appearance and
            capabilities, Charizard is known to be proud and noble, never using
            its flames against weaker opponents.
